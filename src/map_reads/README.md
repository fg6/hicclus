# chrpos 
C++ code to read a Ref fasta, a draft fasta and an alignment file to reset the positioning scheme of the alignements
according to an index that start with the first position in the first chr/contig in the ref/draft fasta, and continue
through all positions and all crhs/ctgs. This create an alignment file compatible with the ACT visualization tool.
